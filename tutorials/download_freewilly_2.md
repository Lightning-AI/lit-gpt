Stability AI announced FreeWilly inspired by the methodology pioneered by Microsoft in its paper: "Orca: Progressive Learning from Complex Explanation Traces of GPT-4‚Äù.
FreeWilly2 leverages the LLaMA 2 70B foundation model to reach a performance that compares favorably with GPT-3.5 for some tasks.

To see all the available checkpoints, run:

```bash
python scripts/download.py | grep FreeWilly2
```

which will print

```text
stabilityai/FreeWilly2
```

In order to use a specific checkpoint, for instance [FreeWilly2](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/FreeWilly2), download the weights and convert the checkpoint to the lit-gpt format.


```bash
pip install huggingface_hub

python scripts/download.py --repo_id stabilityai/FreeWilly2

python scripts/convert_hf_checkpoint.py --checkpoint_dir checkpoints/stabilityai/FreeWilly2
```

You're done! To execute the model just run:

```bash
pip install sentencepiece

python chat/base.py --checkpoint_dir checkpoints/stabilityai/FreeWilly2
```
